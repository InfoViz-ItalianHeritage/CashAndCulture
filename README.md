# CHRS
Final project for the course of Information Visualization 2024-2025 held at University of Bologna by professor D'Aquino.

This project analyzes how public funding for cultural-heritage and tourism projects has been distributed across Italian regions and compares those investments with the number of visitors each region received in the same years (2014 â†’ 2024). The goal is to identify regional mismatches (e.g., high funding / low visitation or vice versa), temporal trends, and possible explanations that can inform policy discussion and further research.

# Workflow summary
1. Retrieve data: download and clean the datasets creating new files useful for our analysis:
    - OpenCoesione.csv includes the information about project fundings during the years (1997-2027)
    - Mic_visitors.csv collects the number of visitors to cultural institutions divided by region (2014-2024)
    - Mic_income.csv collects incomes of cultural institutions divided by region (2014-2024)
2. Analyze funding policies in Italy:
    - heatmap per region and year
3. Analyze trends of visitors in cultural institutions:
    - barchart showing flux per year
    - bubble map showing flux per region
 4. something useful out of it
