# Cash & Culture: Who Gets Funded, Who Gets Visited
Final project for the course of Information Visualization 2024-2025 held at University of Bologna by professor D'Aquino.

This project analyzes how public funding for cultural-heritage and tourism projects has been distributed across Italian regions and compares those investments with the number of visitors each region received in the same years (2014 → 2024). The goal is to identify regional mismatches (e.g. high funding / low visitation or vice versa), temporal trends, and possible explanations that can inform policy discussion and further research.

# Research Questions
RQ1

RQ2

RQ3
How is the trends of regional visitors’ participation in the selected years?
